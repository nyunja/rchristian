**Do you want to start a chicken farm as a beginner? If YES, here is a 16-step guide on how to start a poultry farming business with no money or experience**. There are usually two ways by which chickens are raised in a poultry farm.

**The conventional system**, where the birds are confined and where you can easily control the lightning as well as temperature; and the **free-range system** where the chickens are allowed to roam freely and behave as naturally as possible. The chicken industry has two main parts:

- Layers, where the chickens bred also lay or produce eggs
- Broilers, where chicken are bred mainly for meat

Whatever sector you finally decide on, should be one where you have technical knowledge required and also one that should be profitable for you.
